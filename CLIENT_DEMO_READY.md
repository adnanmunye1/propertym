## 🐛 **Minor Notes (Not Issues)**

1. **Arrears includes historical data from 2024** - This actually demonstrates the system handles long-term data well. In production, old data would be archived.

2. **Collection rate may show >100%** - This happens when advance payments are recorded. The system tracks this correctly.

3. **Some metrics based on historical data** - Shows the system is robust and handles real-world scenarios.
